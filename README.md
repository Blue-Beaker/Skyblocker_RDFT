#### By myself:
- Ability Cooldown Display
- Rescale tablist without changing Global GUI Size
- Configureable position and size for dungeon map
- Waypoints feature optimized for skyblock
- Add coords from chat to waypoints quickly
- Wishing compass and Ancestral spade locator(Alpha but usable)  
######    Andestral spade locator is inaccurate because the spade draws curves instead of lines. However this can still be useful for digging multiple burrow chains at the same time.

- Hide spamming messages when mining in unbreakable area in crystal hollows
- 1.8 Player hitbox
- Item corner marks for potion/book levels, prehistoric egg steps and some other items
